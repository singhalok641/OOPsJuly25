    1. It's a class that cannot be instantiated
    2. Animal class is a good example
    3. Animal is nothing but an abstract concept
    4. You would create objects of Dog, Cat, Bird

    key properties of abstract classes:
    1. Declared with an abstract keyword
    2. Can have both abstract methods(without a body) and
    concrete methods(with a full implementation)
    3. Can have constructors, instance variables and static variables
    4. A class can only extend one abstract class

    Abstract class establishes an "is-a" relationship
